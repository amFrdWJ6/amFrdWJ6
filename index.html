      <div class="w80">
        <h3>
          Here, I am addressing the gap between the end of 2022 and nowadays. 
        </h3>

        <p>
          TL;DR: Life fudged me up, so I decided to address my problems, needs, and desires.
        </p>

        <p>
          Life was good and easy, with work providing satisfying challenges. However, weight gain led to health issues with my knee, and that prevented me from focusing on my hobbies (gardening, hiking), which are therapeutic for me. It got worse when I faced loss due to covid, which evolved into additional family issues. I felt preoccupied with my personal and work life. Life was not good and easy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dreaming of a house outside the city with a large garden, regaining my health, and living a peaceful life again, my wife and I decided to pursue our long-held desires. Leaving our jobs, we bought an old house for renovation. As our new home became livable and I regained control of my weight (lost 40kg+), I hesitated to return to corporate DevOps.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having worked closely with developers for the last few years, I considered a change. Exploring options, I found TypeScript and web development to be the right fit. And here I am.
